Cell-Diff is free software, distributed under the GNU General Public License. 

If you want to distribute a modified version or use part of Cell-Diff
in your own program, remember that the entire modified code must be licensed 
under GPL, and that it must clearly be labeled as derived work. It should 
not use the name "Cell-Diff", and make sure support questions are
directed to you instead of the Cell-Diff developers.

Cell-diff is a suite of tools for performing analyic parameter fitting
for stochastic cell differentiation models, such as the classic Till Model.
